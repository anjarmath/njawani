_Njawani is an object detection app for learning aksara Jawa, one of traditional script in Indonesia._

### Why build this app?
Javanese script is a traditional script in Indonesia that is used to write on various subjects such as books or notes. Unfortunately, the writing of Javanese script has been increasingly abandoned, one of which is due to modernization. Therefore, learning Javanese script must also follow technological developments. The purpose of this study is to build  Njawani application that aims to introduce Javanese script using the real time object detection feature.
